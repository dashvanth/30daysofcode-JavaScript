Welcome to my JavaScript journey! I have taken up the **#30DaysOfCode** challenge to level up my skills and knowledge in JavaScript. In this repository, I will be sharing my daily learnings from **Day 01** to **Day 30**. Each day, I will update my progress and learnings on LinkedIn, so make sure to connect with me there for regular updates.

## üìö Topics Covered

Throughout this challenge, I will be diving into a **wide range of topics** in JavaScript. From **fundamental concepts** to **advanced techniques**, here are some of the **amazing topics** you can expect to find in my daily updates:

- JavaScript Fundamentals inlcuding variables, datatypes, control statements, operators, loops etc..

## üóìÔ∏è Daily Updates
