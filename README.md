# üöÄ JavaScript Journey: #30DaysOfCode Challenge

Welcome to my JavaScript journey! I have taken up the **#30DaysOfCode** challenge to level up my skills and knowledge in JavaScript. In this repository, I will be sharing my daily learnings from **Day 01** to **Day 30**. Each day, I will update my progress and learnings on LinkedIn, so make sure to connect with me there for regular updates.

## üìö Topics Covered

Throughout this challenge, I will be diving into a **wide range of topics** in JavaScript. From **fundamental concepts** to **advanced techniques**, here are some of the **amazing topics** you can expect to find in my daily updates:

- JavaScript Fundamentals inlcuding variables, datatypes, control statements, operators, loops etc..

## üóìÔ∏è Daily Updates

For each day of this challenge, I will create a dedicated folder that contains my learnings and code examples for that particular day. Here is an overview of the folder structure:

- **[Day - 01](/Day%2001)**: [JS Fundamentals]
  1. **Introduction to JavaScript:** Basics and role in web development.
  2. **Including JavaScript:** Methods to include JavaScript code in HTML.
  3. **Variables:** Declaration, types, and naming rules.
  4. **Data Types:** Numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.
  5. **Operators:** Arithmetic, assignment, logical, and comparison.
  6. **Control Statements:** `if...else` and `switch case`.
  7. **Loops:** `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

- **[Day 02](/Day%2002)**: [Topic]
1. **Objects in JavaScript:** Understand the concept of objects and their importance in JavaScript.
2. **Creation of Objects:** Explore different ways to create objects, such as object literals and the `new` keyword.
3. **Functions in Objects (Methods):** Learn how to define functions within objects, commonly known as methods.
4. **Factory Function:** Discover the concept of factory functions, which allow us to create multiple objects with similar properties and behaviors.
5. **Constructor Function:** Explore constructor functions as a way to create objects with shared properties and methods using the `new` keyword.
6. **Dynamic Nature of Objects:** Understand how JavaScript objects can be modified dynamically by adding or removing properties and methods.
7. **`this` and `delete` Keywords:** Gain insights into the usage of the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, and the `delete` keyword to remove properties from objects.

... continuing the structure for each day ...

Feel free to explore the folders and code files to follow my progress throughout this challenge. I hope you find this repository insightful and inspiring for your own JavaScript journey.
