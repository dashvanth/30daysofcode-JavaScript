# 🚀 JavaScript Journey: #30DaysOfCode Challenge

Welcome to my JavaScript journey! I have taken up the **#30DaysOfCode** challenge to level up my skills and knowledge in JavaScript. In this repository, I will be sharing my daily learnings from **Day 01** to **Day 30**. Each day, I will update my progress and learnings on LinkedIn, so make sure to connect with me there for regular updates.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Throughout this challenge, I will be diving into a **wide range of topics** in JavaScript. From **fundamental concepts** to **advanced techniques**, here are some of the **amazing topics** you can expect to find in my daily updates:

- JavaScript basics and syntax 📝
- Variables, data types, and operators

## 🗓️ Daily Updates

For each day of this challenge, I will create a dedicated folder that contains my learnings and code examples for that particular day. Here is an overview of the folder structure:

- **[Day 01](/Day%2001)**: [Topic]
  - [Topic]-examples.js: JavaScript code examples 🚀
  - [Topic]-notes.md: Detailed notes and explanations 📝
  - [Topic]-resources.md: Additional resources for further exploration 📚

- **[Day 02](/Day%2002)**: [Topic]
  - [Topic]-examples.js
  - [Topic]-notes.md
  - [Topic]-resources.md

... continue the structure for each day ...
