# Day 03: Primitives & References in JavaScript

Welcome to Day 03 of my #30DaysOfCode challenge in JavaScript! In this folder, I will be sharing my key learnings from the second day of the challenge. Let's dive into primitive and references types in JavaScript!

## ðŸŒŸ What I've Learned

On Day 03, I covered the following topics:

1. **Prmitives in javascript:** primitives types include number,string, boolean etc..
    Primitive types copy the value not address (Primitive are copied by their variables.)

2. **References in javascript:** Reference types include functions, objects, arrays etc..
     reference types copy the addres of the variable  so both values will be pointing at the same address so whatever you change it will be reflect on the other copied variables also.(Reference are copied by their address)

3. **PassbyValue & PassbyReference:** Used passbyvalue and passbyreference in refernce types. 


Feel free to explore the code examples and notes provided in this folder to deepen your understanding of these topics.
