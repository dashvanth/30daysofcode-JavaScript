# Day 02: Objects in JavaScript

Welcome to Day 02 of my #30DaysOfCode challenge in JavaScript! In this folder, I will be sharing my key learnings from the second day of the challenge. Let's dive into objects and functions in JavaScript!

## ðŸŒŸ What I've Learned

On Day 02, I covered the following topics:

1. **Objects in JavaScript:** Understand the concept of objects and their importance in JavaScript.

2. **Creation of Objects:** Explore different ways to create objects, such as object literals and the `new` keyword.

3. **Functions in Objects (Methods):** Learn how to define functions within objects, commonly known as methods.

4. **Factory Function:** Discover the concept of factory functions, which allow us to create multiple objects with similar properties and behaviors.

5. **Constructor Function:** Explore constructor functions as a way to create objects with shared properties and methods using the `new` keyword.

6. **Dynamic Nature of Objects:** Understand how JavaScript objects can be modified dynamically by adding or removing properties and methods.

7. **`this` and `delete` Keywords:** Gain insights into the usage of the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, and the `delete` keyword to remove properties from objects.

Feel free to explore the code examples and notes provided in this folder to deepen your understanding of these topics.
